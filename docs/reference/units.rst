**MoSDeF-dihedral-fit** utilizes the `unyt <https://unyt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ package for the temperature units.

.. note::
    This is required for a typical user; however the units can be found in the following documentation:
        * `MoSDeF-GOMC <https://github.com/GOMC-WSU/MoSDeF-GOMC/tree/master/mosdef_gomc>`_
        * `mBuild <https://mbuild.mosdef.org/en/stable/>`_ -- A hierarchical, component based molecule builder
	    * `foyer <https://foyer.mosdef.org/en/stable/>`_ -- A package for atom-typing as well as applying and disseminating forcefields
	    * `GMSO <https://gmso.mosdef.org/en/stable/>`_ -- Flexible storage of chemical topology for molecular simulation
        * `forcefield-utilities <https://github.com/mosdef-hub/forcefield-utilities/>`_
        * `Gaussian <https://gaussian.com>`_
