vmd-python
----------

This software is classified as a "derivative work" of the original Visual Molecular Dynamics software. It uses the main VMD source code and Python compilation options as well as code I have written for simple compilation and installation, as well as several patches I have applied.

As such, this is a MODIFIED VERSION of VMD and is not the original software distributed by Illinois.

"This software includes code developed by the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."
